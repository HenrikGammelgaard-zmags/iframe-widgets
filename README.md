# Iframe Widgets

Reusable Zmags Iframe widgets with various configuration options.

## Usage

1. Open the widget configuration tool. There's a demo version hosted [here](http://lugribossk.github.io/iframe-widgets/target/configure/configure.html).
2. Configure the widget with the options you want.
3. Use the Widget URL to view or use the widget standalone.

You can also create the URL parameters for the widget manually, or save them in the 'widget.html' file as a preset (this exposes a few additional options that are not available in the configuration tool) if hosting it yourself.

## Browser support

Only tested sporadically in browsers other than Chrome for Windows so far.
Should hopefully work in all modern (IE 9+) browsers.

## Building

Build with Grunt using 'grunt widget configure', then upload the files in `target` to your own server.
